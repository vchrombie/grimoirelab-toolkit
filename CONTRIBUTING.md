# Contributing to GrimoireLab Toolkit

There are some general guidelines and information related to how we 
contribute to GrimoireLab. You can know more about them from here, 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Toolkit is one of the components in the 
[GrimoireLab toolset](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab#grimoirelab-components) 
which stores the common functions used across GrimoireLab projects.

## Releases

GrimoireLab will deliver frequent coordinated releases of several of
the code in its repositories. These releases are generated by using 
[Bitergia/release-tools](https://github.com/Bitergia/release-tools).

### Changelog Entries

The contributors need to create note entries about the changes in the code. 
These notes will be included in the release notes. The contributors can use the 
interactive [changelog](https://github.com/Bitergia/release-tools#changelog) 
tool for this purpose. 

Changelog entries use [YAML format](https://yaml.org/). Remember you can write blocks 
of text using `>` character at the beginning of each block. See the next example:
```
title: 'Fix bug #666'
category: fixed
author: John Smith <jsmith@example.com>
issue: 666
notes: >
  The bug was making impossible to cast a spell on
  a magician.
```

These changelog entries would be included in the release notes which is read by 
users who might not know anything about the internals of the code. The `notes` 
should be written in simple language that is understandable by the audience.
